# Burger

- My Eat-da-burger application displays a list of burgers in two sections. One section is a list of uneaten burgers and the other is a list of burgers that have been eaten. It also allows users to create new burgers to add to the uneaten list. If a burger is in the uneaten list it can be "eaten" by clicking the Devour button. Once a burger has been eaten it is moved to the eaten section. The eaten burgers can be remade by pressing the remake button which places them back in the uneaten section.

- The apps files are organized using MVC. I have a config folder to hold my connection and orm javascript files. I have a controllers folder that holds my controller file for the routes. My db folder has my schema and seeds files for the data. My public folder holds all my css, assets and front end javascript files. Lastly, my views folder is where the html content is contained inside multiple handlebars folders making use of partials.

- The technologies i used to create this application were handlebars, express, javascript, sql and an orm. I also used node to run my application during development.
